## TypeScript/WebSocket Chat Server ##

This is a very straight forward chat server (no persistence) that is meant to be
used with the companion project [typeScriptChatServer](https://github.com/nprice1/typeScriptChatClient).

### Usage ###

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` then run `npm run build`.
3. Run `npm start`  

That's it! You should have a server listening on port 3000. See the [typeScriptChatServer](https://github.com/nprice1/typeScriptChatClient)
project for instructions on how to connect to the server and start chatting.
